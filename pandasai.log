def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 give me a pie chart  to understand country split  

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 whats the profit from Canada 

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT SUM(CAST(Profit AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Profit

profit_data = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
total_profit = profit_data['Total_Profit'].iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': total_profit}

However, it resulted in the following error:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 Canada profit

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 What is the total profit by country?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT Country, SUM(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(" Profit ", '$', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Profit
FROM table_temp_data_for_pai
GROUP BY Country
"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is the total profit by country?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

sql_query = 'SELECT SUM(" Profit ") as Total_Profit FROM table_temp_data_for_pai'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
total_profit = df.loc[0, 'Total_Profit']
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': total_profit}

However, it resulted in the following error:

# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is the total profit by country?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """

### QUERY
 how many loans paid off on october

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_data WHERE loan_status = 'PAIDOFF' AND strftime('%m', paid_off_time) = '10'"
loans_paid_off_in_october = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': loans_paid_off_in_october}

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 how many loans paid off on october

You generated the following Python code:
sql_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_data WHERE loan_status = 'PAIDOFF' AND strftime('%m', datetime(substr(paid_off_time, instr(paid_off_time, '/') + 1, 4) || '-' || substr(paid_off_time, 1, instr(paid_off_time, '/') - 1) || '-' || substr(paid_off_time, instr(paid_off_time, '/') + 5, 2))) = '10'"
loans_paid_off_in_october = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': loans_paid_off_in_october}

However, it resulted in the following error:

```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 how many loans paid off in october 

You generated the following Python code:
sql_query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as Loans_Paid_Off_In_October FROM table_data WHERE loan_status = 'PAIDOFF' AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TIMESTAMP(paid_off_time)) = 10"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
num_loans_paid_off = df.iloc[0]['Loans_Paid_Off_In_October']
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': num_loans_paid_off}

However, it resulted in the following error:
