<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 give me a pie chart  to understand country split  

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

You generated the following Python code:

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 whats the profit from Canada 

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 whats the profit from Canada 

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT SUM(CAST(Profit AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Profit

profit_data = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
total_profit = profit_data['Total_Profit'].iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': total_profit}

However, it resulted in the following error:

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

</function>


Update this initial code:
```python

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what is the total profit from canada 

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the total profit from canada 

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT SUM(CAST(Profit AS FLOAT)) AS Total_Profit

result = {'type': 'number', 'value': total_profit}

However, it resulted in the following error:

 whats the profit in Canada 

You generated the following Python code:

</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 whats the profit in Canada

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is total profit from country

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is total profit from country

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 What is total profit from country

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
df['Profit'] = df['Profit'].replace({'\\$': '', ',': ''}, regex=True).astype(float)
sql_query = """
SELECT Country, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM table_temp_data_for_pai
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC
"""
total_profit_df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': total_profit_df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
